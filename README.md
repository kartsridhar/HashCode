# Google Hash Code 2019 Pizza Practice Problem

* My friend and I made an attempt to come up with a python script for the 2019 Pizza Problem. This was also the qualifying problem for the 2018 Hash Code.
* To run the script, clone or download this repository (as a zip) and type ``` python solution.py a_example.in ``` in your terminal. Open the output text file to see results

### Extra
* As of now, our output file is not being written properly. Will have a check and update the repo accordingly..
* We used this [link](https://youtu.be/TVk4C-MU8no) as a reference for better code framework.
